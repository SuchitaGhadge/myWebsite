            <p>Year 2016 was about to end.  My uncle hosted a party at 31st December at his home in Khar road, Mumbai and after a party we had planned a trip to Mahabaleshwar. Our party got over at 1 AM and we departed towards Mahabaleshwar in a mini bus which we hired for 3 days. But that was a New Year’s night. Travelling was not the same as always. There was too much checking on road by Mumbai police to make sure that no one is drunk while driving. Of course, no one wants to start their New Year with an accident or death. We got obstructed two times, once to check where driver is drunk or not and second time because our driver forgot his uniform. We had to go to the Police station pay the penalty and then got a permission to proceed. Around one hour is wasted. Not so good start of a journey. </p>

            <p>It’s around 6 AM. We started climbing the Mahabaleshwar ghat. The road was filled with dense fog. We barely had any visibility on road. We were driving slowly and carefully. Finally, at 7:30 AM we reached at destination village called Parvatipur (Paar). Every one of us got refreshed, took the darshan of the village Ramvardaini temple and headed towards our next destination, Shetra Mahabasleshwar (Old Mahabaleshwar). We were going to visit the old temples called Mahabaleshwar Temple and Krushnai temple. We reached there around 11 AM and parked our mini bus at the parking space available at that place. As soon as I get off of the but I saw an old board, Krushnai temple directing towards right. There was a narrow unconstructed road covered with trees on both side of road. </p>

            <img class="img-blog" src="/images/img-krushnai2.jpg" alt="img-krushnai2">

            <p>I was super excited to walk on that road so I started walking ahead of everyone. Road was fully covered with all kinds of trees and bushes. After walking for 6-7 minutes the road got split into two paths. There was another board directing towards left, Krushnai temple written on it. I looked back to see for others. Everyone was on some distance away from me, talking some photos of them. I moved forward. After walking for a while, I saw an old temple situated at the center of a small ground. A gate of that temple was on the other side. I walked around and saw a small statue Nandi followed by two big Kunds with continuous flow of clean and cold water. The whole Nandi was made of a black stone, a single piece of stone having a hole in backside. If you try to see through that hole you can see the Shivalinga. I showed that to all my family members. Entire temple was built in black stone. There were beautiful sculptures of many Hindu idols was carved on pillars of a temple. I went down towards kund to wash my feet. The water bone-chilling. After washing feet in the first kund, I went in the garbhgriha where the Shivalinga was situated. The garbhgriha was colder than the outside environment. I worship the God Shiva. Then I asked the pujari, who was present there to take care of the temple, who built this temple? “The Pandvas, around 5500 years ago.” pujari said. What? 5500 years ago? Wow! I exclaimed. The temple was in pretty good condition even after 5500 years. Clean and cold water flows 24/7 in all seasons. But where the water is coming from? I roamed all around the temple to check the source of the water but couldn’t find anything. What an architecture I wondered. </p>

            <p>We spend the entire day by siting there and clicking some good photos. Enjoying a spectacular view of Venna lake from the temple and experiencing a great example of ancient architecture. The Sun of about to set and we had to leave the temple. That was my first ever visit to an ancient temple. It left me with a lot of question in mind about the art of an ancient architecture and a sense of calmness at the same time. </p>
